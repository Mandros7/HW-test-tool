# HW Testing Tool

## Objective
The purpose of this project is to develop a **_HW-In-Loop (HIL)_ testing tool** to simplify the development of electronic devices.

## Motivation
Although it may be quite simple to develop and debug SW nowadays using very powerful tools which automatize its development as well as its validation and verification, it is still quite complicated to obtain the same kind of approach for HW development. This tool intends to simplify this tasks.
